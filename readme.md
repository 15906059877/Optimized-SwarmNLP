# Optimized Swarm NLP

This project implements particle swarm optimization to find approximate solutions to non-linear programming and multi-criteria decision-making problems.

## Usage:
1. Define one or multiple objective functions in any number of dimensions.
2. Specify your constraints.
3. Execute the swarm until an acceptable solution is found. 

There may be numerous solutions in the non-dominating set. A selection of these solutions is shown as orange dots on the User Interface (UI).

The UI also enables users to view a cross-section of any 2 dimensions for any objective function.

A shaded red region signifies infeasible solutions while lighter and darker regions on the screen denote high and low function values respectively.
